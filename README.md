The platform supports role-based access, with users able to book rooms and view their reservations also edit them by changing the date, but no later than 1 month from the original date and no earlier than the original date , 
admins able to manage room availability, reservations, and rooms.
The system includes meal selections (non or breakfast or breakfast and dinner), and administrators can upload images for room categories and create new one if needed. It ensures secure login through Spring Security and manages data using Hibernate.
